# CS:GO Hub Discord bot

## What does it do?
This bot enables users to link their steam accounts to their discord accounts.
When you are in a voice channel, you can use the /show-team command to show the CS:GO friend codes of the other users in voice who have linked their accounts

## How do I set it up?
You can't currently but I will release the backend code soon enough, until then it's recommended you use the (https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1012444172369805342&permissions=551954680848&scope=applications.commands%20bot)[default bot]
