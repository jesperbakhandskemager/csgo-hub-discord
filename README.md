# CS:GO Hub Discord bot

## What does it do?
This bot enables users to link their steam account with their discord account allowing friends to easily find each others CS:GO friend codes.
When in a voice channel, you can use the `/show-team` command which will show the CS:GO friend codes of all other people in the same voice channel as you with a linked account.
